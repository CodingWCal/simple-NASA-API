## How It's Made:


### Tech used: HTML, CSS and JavaScript hosted on Netlify
Great use of API fetch requests, this was a good experiment utilizing API's for different features. Also made note to catch errors if they came into place, used the open source documentation of the NASA APOD API to recall the names of the properties.


### Future Optimizations:
Will be continuously updating this project and repo in near future with additional media queries and fixing content spacing, to adapt this to any possible screen size without break points.


### Lessons Learned:
I thoroughly enjoyed the creation process, with finding a simple gif background image and a royalty free smooth jazz song that can be played from a hidden player on top of the page! I had so much fun customizing this project and really making it my own. I learned how to better use API's, navigate documentation, and better use developer tools in browser to analyze my HTTPS and JSON requests.


### Instructions for Best User Experience: How to Use

ðŸŽµ Play Background Music â€“ Click the hidden audio player at the top of the screen to enjoy a smooth jazz soundtrack inspired by Cowboy Bebop and Guardians of the Galaxy.

ðŸ“… Enter a Date â€“ Use the white input box to select a date of your choice.

ðŸš€ Click "Lift Off" â€“ Submit your date to retrieve NASAâ€™s Astronomy Picture of the Day!

Hope you enjoy the royalty-free, open-source smooth jazz I found to set the mood for your space exploration! Let me know what you think! ðŸŒŒâœ¨
